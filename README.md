# HW1
## W1L2 In-Class Activity

Put your notes from the W1L2 (Thurs, Jan 9) in-class activity here.

## Devlog
Prompt: Include the HW1 break-down exercise you wrote during the Week 1 - Lecture 2 (Jan 9) in-class activity (above). If you did not attend and perform this activity, review the lecture slides and write your own plan for how you believe HW1 should be built. If your initially proposed plan turned out significantly different than the activity answers given by Prof Reid, you may want to note what was different. Then, write about how the plan you wrote in the break-down connects to the code you wrote. Cite specific class names and method names in the code and GameObjects in your Unity Scene.

Write your Devlog here!
 I kind of forgot some of the codes when I was completing this assignment, but by reviewing the course content of 31, I reviewed the code for the movement, and also for the newly learned code Instantiate, after reviewing the information and asking the instructor in class, I have understood how the METHOD goes about using it.
